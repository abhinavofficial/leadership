2. Constructing the Arugment(s)
3. Validating the Argument(s)
4. Conclusion

_Identifying the Premise(s)_<br>
Premise is the basic claim made which initiates the critical thinking process. There could be one or more premises in the form of statements or ideas put in the favor of the claim made. Identifying the appropriate premise is important as this becomes the basis of whole discussion.

_Constructing the Argument(s)_<br>
Identified premise of a problem might or might not be true. Arguments is to have set of reasons & evidences to either prove the claim/premise or disapprove.
Constructing the arguements puts a strcuture to properly sail through the discussions in order to reach to some conclusion.

_Validating the Argument(s)_<br>
Like premise, arguments could also be false or lacking factual evidences. It requires an iterative process to continously validate the arguments made by means of collecting them from authentic sources, analysing them with other supported information and involving other stakeholders.

_Conclusion_<br>
A conclusion is the final claim that is supported with evidence and reasons.
