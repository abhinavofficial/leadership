# Critical Thinking
It's one of the most important aspects of **Critical People Capabilities**.
Critical Thinking is a deliberated act of cognitive thoughts to actively and skillfully conceptualizing, applying, analysing, synthesizing and evaluating information gathered by observations, experience, reasoning or communication as a guide.

There should be a continous awareness & effort to assess whether the information collected is appropriate and whether we should accept, reject or suspend or counter question the judgement made about a claim.

**Approcah to Critical Thinking**
1. Identifying the Premise(s)
2. Constructing the Arugment(s)
3. Validating the Argument(s)
4. Conclusion

_Identifying the Premise(s)_<br>
Premise is the basic claim made which initiates the critical thinking process. There could be one or more premises in the form of statements or ideas put in the favor of the claim made. Identifying the appropriate premise is important as this becomes the basis of whole discussion.

_Constructing the Argument(s)_<br>
Identified premise of a problem might or might not be true. Arguments is to have set of reasons & evidences to either prove the claim/premise or disapprove.
Constructing the arguements puts a strcuture to properly sail through the discussions in order to reach to some conclusion.

_Validating the Argument(s)_<br>
Like premise, arguments could also be false or lacking factual evidences. It requires an iterative process to continously validate the arguments made by means of collecting them from authentic sources, analysing them with other supported information and involving other stakeholders.

_Conclusion_<br>
A conclusion is the final claim that is supported with evidence and reasons.

Example<br>
Claim: Plato drinks beer.<br>

Premise 1: All philosophers drink beer.<br>

Premise 2:  Plato is a philosopher.<br>

Conclusion:  Therefore, Plato drinks beer.<br>

Notice that so long as we accept Premise 1 and Premise 2 as true, then we must also accept the conclusion.  This is what we mean by “the conclusion ‘follows’ from the premises.”

And therefore, constructing & validating the argument becomes critical to accept or reject the premises straight away to derive to logical conclusion.

**Many arguments can also contain what are called “hidden,” “unstated,” or “assumed” premises. These premises are not strong or direct enough but could act as presumption or might also help in case of missing other conceret premises.**

<h4>Types of Arguments</h4>
In critical thinking, arguments can be categorized based on the way their premises support their conclusions. Here are the main types of arguments:<br>
<h5>Deductive Arguments:<h5><br>
A deductive argument is one where the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. If the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. In this scenario we start with generalized premises and try to establish the facts to be more specific to draw the conclusion.

example:<br>
P1: All people working in banks are CAs.
P2: Joseph works in a bank.
C1: Joseph is a CA.

<h5>Inductive Arguments:<h5><br>
An inductive argument is one where the premises provide probable support for the conclusion but do not guarantee it. The conclusion is likely, but not certain, even if the premises are true.
This helps where we have limited information available to start with smaller set of evidences and then try to generalize it to conclude.
P1: In the past, the sun has risen every day.
P2: Tomorrow is another day
C1: Therefore, the sun will rise tomorrow

<h5>Abductive Arguments:<h5><br>
Abductive reasoning, also known as inference to the best explanation, occurs when we begin with an observation and seek the simplest or most likely explanation.
It does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion, but suggests the best possible explanation based on available evidence.

<h5>Analogical Arguments:<h5><br>
An analogical argument compares two things that are similar in some respects, and argues that since one has a particular property, the other likely has it as well.

<h5>Conditional Arguments:<h5><br>
A conditional argument involves premises that rely on "if-then" statements (conditionals). The argument’s strength depends on whether the conditional relationship is accurately represented.

<h5>Fallacious Arguments:<h5><br>
These are arguments that may appear valid or sound on the surface but contain errors in reasoning that undermine their logical structure.

*Each type of argument has its own method for supporting conclusions and is evaluated differently in critical thinking depending on the logical or probabilistic relationship between premises and conclusion.*
